Installation from Debian packages

    For the <release series> specify the major version number, without dot, and with an appended x.
    The latest <release series> is 311x.

    For older releases, the <release series> can be one of 30x, 22x, or 21x.
    Add the Apache repository of Cassandra to /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list, for example for the latest 3.11 version:

## echo "deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 22x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list

    Add the Apache Cassandra repository keys:

## curl https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -

    Update the repositories:

## sudo apt-get update

## If you encounter this error:

## GPG error: http://www.apache.org 311x InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A278B781FE4B2BDA

Then add the public key A278B781FE4B2BDA as follows:

## sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key A278B781FE4B2BDA

and repeat sudo apt-get update. The actual key may be different, you get it from the error message itself. For a full list of Apache contributors public keys, you can refer to https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS.

    Install Cassandra:

sudo apt-get install cassandra

    You can start Cassandra with sudo service cassandra start and stop it with sudo service cassandra stop. However, normally the service will start automatically. For this reason be sure to stop it if you need to make any configuration changes.
    Verify that Cassandra is running by invoking nodetool status from the command line.
    The default location of configuration files is /etc/cassandra.
    The default location of log and data directories is /var/log/cassandra/ and /var/lib/cassandra.
    Start-up options (heap size, etc) can be configured in /etc/default/cassandra.

Installation from RPM packages

    For the <release series> specify the major version number, without dot, and with an appended x.
    The latest <release series> is 311x.
    For older releases, the <release series> can be one of 30x, 22x, or 21x.

    (Not all versions of Apache Cassandra are available, since building RPMs is a recent addition to the project.)
    Add the Apache repository of Cassandra to /etc/yum.repos.d/cassandra.repo, for example for the latest 3.11 version:

[cassandra]
name=Apache Cassandra
baseurl=https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/redhat/311x/
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS

    Install Cassandra, accepting the gpg key import prompts:

sudo yum install cassandra

Start Cassandra (will not start automatically):

service cassandra start

Systemd based distributions may require to run systemctl daemon-reload once to make Cassandra available as a systemd service. This should happen automatically by running the command above.

Make Cassandra start automatically after reboot:

chkconfig cassandra on

Please note that official RPMs for Apache Cassandra only have been available recently and are not tested thoroughly on all platforms yet. We appreciate your feedback and support and ask you to post details on any issues in the corresponding Jira ticket.
